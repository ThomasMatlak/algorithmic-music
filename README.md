Software for my senior thesis

### Purpose of This Project ###
This project is part of my Senior Independent Study project at The College of Wooster, in fulfillment of the Computer Science and Mathematics majors.

### Project Layout ###

* `basicMarkovChain` contains prototype code for the Markov model
* `intervalMarkovChain` contains code for using Markov models to generate a melody with separate chains used to choose rhythmic values and intervals between notes
* `geneticAlgorithms` contains the code for the genetic algorithm code and LSTM code. Requires the `multiprocess` Python library.
* `MusicScore.py` contains code prototyping output from some Python representation to ABC notation. It has been deprecated since the project started using `music21`
